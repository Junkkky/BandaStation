 * Per-compartment damage summary for the helm, read from the physical hull: mean pressure, open fire, tiles open to space.
 * Returns `rooms` and the hull silhouette as `rows`, north first: a space for tiles outside the hull, `#` for walls,
 * `!` for breaches, otherwise the [COMPARTMENT_CELL_CODES] character of the compartment's index in `rooms`.
 * shortcut: scans the hull footprint on every UI refresh (~1 ms for Raven's 672 tiles); cache per tick once capital hulls exist.
